FS2004 Teledyne Continental sound set created by Gary Jones.

=================


Designed for use with the Aero Commander 560 model by Milton Shupe.
Will suit most aircraft powered by TSIO engines.

================


These sounds are released as FREEWARE and must be kept so.

================

Some default MSFS sounds are also used to make this set possible.

================

Enjoy!
